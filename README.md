ColorsJS
========

ColorsJS is a simple color pallet which lets the user pick up aesthetically pleasing colors. This is achieved by making use of HSL color notation and setting the saturation value in mid ranges. However if the user pleases to use a different saturation value, it is upto him. This app also gives out the corresponding RGB and HEX values (We dump HSL colors here because unlike RGB and HEX colors, they aren't consistent across all the devices). Also the color pallet can be saved as an image for further use.

* The download option works on Firefox but not on other browsers. Please make sure to turn on the pop-ups for the download option to function.

* Alternatively, you can screenshot the color-stripe if the download option doesn't work.
